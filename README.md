# BadBank

Project Title: Rob's Full Stack Bad Bank!

Description/Motivation: This project was created as part of the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. I previously created a "Bad Bank," but it was only a front end application. This is now full-stack. It allows users to create accounts at this bank, login, make deposits, make withdrawls, view your balance, and even view all user's data. However, authentication will be added at a later date, intended as my capstone project. 

Installation Guidelines: 
1) download the repository 
npm init
npm install express
npm install mongodb
docker run -p 27017:27017 --name badbank -d mongo
